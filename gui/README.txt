RHD2000 USB Interface Software - Source Code (v1.41)
----------------------------------------------------

This directory contains the RHD2000 Interface C++/Qt source code and two supporting files: main.bit
(the FPGA configuration file) and an operating system-specific Opal Kelly library file located in
the 'Opal Kelly library files' directory.

These two supporting files must reside in the directory with the executable file (i.e., the 'debug'
or 'release' folder generated when the code is compiled).  To find the executable directory on
a Mac, right-click on the RHD2000interface.app file generated by Qt, select "Show package contents",
and open the "MacOS" directory.  (Note: Some Mac users have reported that these two files must be
placed in the in same directory as the application instead.)

You should also download and install the USB drivers from the Intan Technologies website before
connecting the RHD2000 USB interface board to a computer.  (They are not included in this zip file.)
However, you can run the RHD2000 interface software in demonstration mode without installing drivers
or plugging in an interface board.

Linux users should first run qmake on the .pro file, and then make.

(Thanks to Josh Siegle at MIT and Open-Ephys.org for tips on Mac and Linux compilation.) 


Other tips on Mac compilation from Tobias Teichert at Columbia University
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

In principle, the RHD2000 software will run on a Mac. However, a couple of tweaks are necessary.
This description is based on exprience using two different machines running MacOSX 10.9

1) Install XCode

2) Install Qt5.2.1 (Make sure to install XCode first)

3) Modify the QT line in the .pro file to read
	QT  += widgets multimedia

4) Fix library issue as described here:
   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20342896/solved-qt5-1-qt5-2-mac-os-10-9-mavericks-xcode-5-0-2-undefined-symbols

   in /Qt5.2.1/5.2.1/clang_64/mkspecs/macx-clang/qmake.conf  (or similar)
   change QMAKE_MACOSX_DEPLYOMENT_TARGET from 10.6 to 10.9


5) add the QSound library to the mainwindow.cpp
	#include <QSound>


6) Change sizes of the GUI windows (For some reason, the mac version of the gui is too small and crops some of the display)

   mainWindow.cpp
   line 264: setFixedSize(1445,1020)

   spikescopedialog.cpp
   line 43: setFixedSize(512, 512)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some users have reported that it is necessary to install Qt with 32-bit support for the okFrontPanel DLL to load properly.

Recommended C++/Qt Resources
----------------------------

The total source code is around 10,000 lines in length, and is written entirely in C++ using the
open-source Qt libraries for multi-platform GUI support. (The files composing the core Rhythm API
are written in straight C++ without using Qt.)

There are countless books and other online resources related to C++ programming, so these will not
be discussed here. For C++ programmers new to Qt, the best place to start is http://qt-project.org.
We recommend downloading the Qt SDK (Software Design Kit) including Qt Creator, Qt Assistant, and the
latest Qt libraries for the operating system of choice.

The best book we have found for first-time Qt programmers is C++ GUI Programming with Qt 4, Second
Edition, by Jasmin Blanchette and Mark Summerfield (ISBN 0-13-235416-0). Chapters 1-8 and 11-12, along
with Appendices A and B, cover nearly all the aspects of Qt used in the RHD2000 interface GUI. The
library documentation available in the Qt Assistant application is also excellent and indispensable.
